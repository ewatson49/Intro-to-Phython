# data manipulation - operators

# in python we have operators that allows us to change data 

# assignments
# use the same combination of the equal to give a variable a value 

name = 'laj' # the equal sign is a operator 
willitsnow =True
numberofsandwitchs = 10


# comparsion 
#allow us to evaluate data based on factors
# greater than or less than 

10 < 20 # is 10 less than 20
20.34>=0 # is 20.34 greater than or equal to 6 
100 == 100 # is 100 the same as 100
100 != 10 # is 100 not the same as 10 

# logical 
#  true or false checker 
# and- used to compare to conditions that are both true
password = '123'
securityQuestion = 'Watson' 
mathanswer = 4
password == '123'and 4 == mathanswer
password == '123' or 2+3 == mathanswer
# real result flipped to opposite 
not (password == '123' and 4 == mathanswer)





# arithmatic 
# allows us to perform math with specifically with the interger and float data types
